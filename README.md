# Tensor Networks for Perfect Operator

A brief demonstration showing how tensor networks reproduce the perfect operator for linear PDEs on coarse meshes, as described in *[Renormalization Group and Perfect Operators for Stochastic Differential Equations](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.63.036125)*.
